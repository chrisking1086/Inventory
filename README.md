# Inventory App
This Android Application was developed for a fictional customer Mobile2App while I was taking an Android App Development Course at Southern New Hampshire University.

## Application Description
The Inventory App is a simple application targeted at small businesses to allow for managing inventories. The application was written in Java and uses SQLite for the database. There is a login screen, user authentication, registrations, inventory display and inventory manipulation.
