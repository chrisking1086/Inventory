# Inventory App
This Android Application was developed for a fictional customer Mobile2App while I was taking an Android App Development Course at Southern New Hampshire University.

The purpose of the app was to allow users to manage an inventory. This required the functionality of Creating, Reading, Updating and Deleting inventory a SQLite database through an android interface. The customer in this scenario wanted the ability to create update and manage users and be notified of when the an item in the inventory has been depleted.

## Application Description
The Inventory App is a simple application targeted at small businesses to allow for managing inventories. The application was written in Java and uses SQLite for the database. There is a login screen, user authentication, registrations, inventory display and inventory manipulation.

For the inventory display I used a Recylcer view with a seperate xml file to create the individual items that would be displayed in the Recycler view. The application has seperate activities for the Login, Registration, Add item, Edit item and Inventory.
